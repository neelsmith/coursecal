The `coursecal` library cleanly separates information about the content of class meetings and other course events from information about scheduling and dates.  This makes it straightforward to reuse simple text files defining course content, and reconfigure information about schedules and calendars for a particular term.

- [User's guide](usersguide/): how to build a course calendar from simple plain-text files that are easy to edit and manage with version control
- [Programmer's guide](codersguide/):  documentation of the conceptual models, how they are implemented in the library, and how to use them in Scala
- API docs: TBA
